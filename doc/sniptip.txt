This plugin is a wrapper around the [sniptip tool](https://github.com/anfelo/sniptip)
to be able to use it from within Neovim. It provides a simple API to save snippets
of text and retrieve them later. See examples below:

                                                              *sniptip.push()*
sniptip.init()

    Initializes the sniptip tool. It creates a directory in the user's home to
    store the snippets.


                                                               *sniptip.add()*

sniptip.add({name})

    Adds a new snippet using the selected lines in visual mode as the content.
    The user is prompted to enter the snippet's {name}.

        sniptip.add("my_snippet")


                                                              *sniptip.show()*

sniptip.show({name})

    Selects a snippet that is already saved by the {name}. If the snippet
    exists it will be pasted below the cursor.

        sniptip.show("my_snippet")


                                                              *sniptip.list()*
sniptip.list()

    Displays a telescope picker with a list of all the snippets saved. After
    selecting one, the snippet will be pasted below the cursor.
